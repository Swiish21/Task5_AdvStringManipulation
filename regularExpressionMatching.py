print(is_match("aa", "a*"))  # Output: True , reason the expression has an asterisk, so it doesn't matter how many 'a's are in the string, it will match the condition
print(is_match("ab", ".*"))  # Output: True , reason is the expression has a dot and then an asterisk, meaning any character(s) are allowed,
print(is_match("mississippi", "mis*is*p*."))  # Output: False , reason is the input string has too many 'i' and 's', but the expression doesn't allow it to have all these 'i's and 's's, hence it will return false.
