File 1: LongestSubstrWithoutRepeatingChar.py, here the challenge was to write a function that finds the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.we begin by defining the function and assigning it a name and parameter s(string), the function 'is_match' is supposed to return a boolean value(true or false). we also assign it another parametre p(string) which will hold the regular expression to be used to check the input string(s). we start by dealing with the case where the regualar expression and string are both empty, if they are we return true because they both match(both are empty), we continue to case where the regex has only one character, where we use an if statement to check if the first character of the regex is the same as the first character of the input string, if so we return true, if not we return false. Finally we deal with the case where the regex has more than one expression, we use an if statement to compare every character of the regex with its corresponding character(s) in the input string, if they are the same we return true, if not we return false. We finish by presenting some test cases for the function to check(encoutered an error where the function was not working as intended on certain test cases, researched solutions but didnt find a practical one)
